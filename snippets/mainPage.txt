          <div class="post-content">
            <p>I'm from an electronics domain and found web development as a barrier for my
            IOT projects as I used either an existing APP or some HTML code, however I didn't have the
          degree of customization that i wanted, finally I made up my mind to learn <em>HTML, CSS, JS.</em></p>
          <p> I began with <strong>Coursera</strong> which had an amazing course by <strong><em>John Hopkin's Whiting school of engineering</em></strong>
          I completed the course and further studied the <em>HTTP and FTP protocol</em>, there was a realtime communication that I found was missing which was
        then achieved by using <em>WebSockets</em>.</p>
        <p>I plan to explore more into Web development and Keep Learning.</p>
